Labs from firs term:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - introduction to the basics of programming (variables, if, for, while, dividing into fuctions, etc.)
6 - A bit more interesting problem: Given an array MxN, you need to calculate the number of "special" elements. A "special" element is an element >= the sum of column without this element. 
7 - working with char[] / My own realisation of getline.
8 - ะก style of working with files. Implementation of work with files + struct + (1 - 7)labs.

Labs from second term: 
1 - Introduction in recursion. Task: find minimum of f(x) = 7 * sin^2(x) in given interval.
2 - Implementation of stack. - pop(), push(), view(), clear(), peek(), sort(). Task: move elements from max-begin to a new stack.
3 - Implementation of queue. -  --//--. Task - Delete max element from queue.
4 - Implementation of Reverse Polish Notation. (i use stack from Lab2 :D)
5 - Implementation of tree. - I made an avl-tree to make it easier to work with the tree, and made my own output in the console (turned out pretty good, I think :D)
